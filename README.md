# TIKKO

A fully responsive web application built with React, TypeScript, and Next.js, using Supabase as the backend database. The app allows users to fill out a form to generate a personalized conference ticket, featuring real-time validation for required fields, email format, and image uploads. It adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and includes smooth hover and focus states for all interactive elements. The project is live and hosted on Vercel.
